# Problem Statement
The problem statement can be defined as follows, ”Given a dataset 
containing attribute of 396 Portuguese students where using the features available 
from dataset and define classification algorithms to identify whether the student 
performs good in final grade exam, also to evaluate different machine learning 
models on the dataset.”

## Description of the Dataset
This data approach student achievement in secondary education of 
two Portuguese schools. The data attributes include student grades, demographic, 
social and school-related features) and it was collected by using school reports 
and questionnaires. Two datasets are provided regarding the performance in two 
distinct subjects: Mathematics (mat) and Portuguese language (por). In [Cortez 
and Silva, 2008], the two data sets were modeled under binary/five-level
classification and regression tasks. Important note: the target attribute G3 has a 
strong correlation with attributes G2 and G1.
